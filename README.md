 # ChatWithPDF using RAG (Retrival Augmented Generation)
 
## Features

- PDF upload and processing
- Question answering based on PDF content
- Utilizes LLAMA 3 model via NVIDIA NIM for natural language processing
- Implements Retrieval Augmented Generation for accurate responses
- Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- NVIDIA API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it

3. Install the required packages: command - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your NVIDIA API key

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

2. Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Upload a PDF file using the file uploader.

4. Click the "Process PDF" button to analyze the document.

5. Once processing is complete, enter your questions in the text input field.

6. View the AI-generated answers and relevant document chunks.

## How It Works

1. The app uses NVIDIA Embeddings to create vector representations of the PDF content.
2. The document is split into chunks and stored in a FAISS vector database.
3. When a question is asked, the app retrieves relevant document chunks using the vector database.
4. The LLAMA 3 model, accessed through NVIDIA NIM, generates an answer based on the retrieved context and the question.
5. The answer is displayed to the user along with the most relevant document chunks.
